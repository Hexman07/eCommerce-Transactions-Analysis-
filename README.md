# eCommerce-Transactions-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes an eCommerce transactions dataset to provide actionable business insights, build a Lookalike Model for customer recommendations, and perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted detailed EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Derived business insights related to customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `Hrishikesh_Jaiswal_EDA.pdf` (PDF report with insights).
  - `Hrishikesh_Jaiswal_EDA.ipynb` (EDA code).

### Lookalike Model
- Built a Lookalike Model that recommends 3 similar customers using RFM metrics and transaction history.
- Applied cosine similarity with PCA-reduced features for efficient computation.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `Hrishikesh_Jaiswal_Lookalike.csv` (Top 3 recommendations for first 20 customers).
  - `Hrishikesh_Jaiswal_Lookalike.ipynb` (Model development code).

### Customer Segmentation
- Implemented K-means clustering on customer RFM metrics and region data.
- Visualized clusters using PCA.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `Hrishikesh_Jaiswal_Clustering.pdf` (Clustering results and insights).
  - `Hrishikesh_Jaiswal_Clustering.ipynb` (Clustering code).
